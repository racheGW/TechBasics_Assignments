Assignment 9
Create a simple interactive game with keyboard / mouse events

The game does not need to be complex or highly polishedâ€”simple rules and visuals are perfectly acceptable, as long as the result is engaging and functional.

Here are a few example ideas to help you get started (feel free to come up with your own):

A gardening game where the user plants different types of plants
A mouse drawing game that uses emojis as brushes
Requirements:

Create subclasses from your main base class. The subclasses shall have its own attribute(s) and method(s).
Use setters and getters for updating of your objects instead of direct manipulation of the attributes
Keyboard/Mouse Interactions are must!
At the end of your code, include a comment block that explains how to interact with your game (controls, objectives, etc.).
Bonus:

Consider what attributes/methods in your class can be private.
Add an initial instruction screen that provides users with gameplay guidance and a start button (text display & start button based on your own research)
