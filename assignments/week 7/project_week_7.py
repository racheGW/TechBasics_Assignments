Assignment 7
Let's make a grade calculator for the class ;)

Download csv file from our shared google spreadsheet for the class
Read the csv in a way that you find meaningful (as list or dictionary?)
Populate the csv up to week 13(no week 6) with random data
Add two more new columns: "Total Points" & "Average Points"
Remember "Total Points" shall be <= 30, it takes the best 10 grades from 12 assignments
Average points can calculate average value based on all submissions
Handle no submission and spaces
Use Exception handling if the csv can't be found.
Save everything as a new csv file
Don't edit the csv file manually. I will test your code with the csv directly downloaded from the Google spreadsheet.
Don't commit the csv file when you submit the assignment!

Bonus:

Display average points for stream A / stream B / each week with print()
Beautify your print results!
