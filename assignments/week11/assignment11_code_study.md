### Assignment 11 "Code Reading Exercise" Weller

1. Where did you find the code and why did you choose it? (Provide the link)

I looked on git hub for a python code that involved organisation. After looking through some of the examples I choose

2.  What does the program do? What's the general structure of the program? 

After some research I found out that the code is a web scraper, so it searches the GSOC (Google summer of Code) organisations from the 2019 archive. With that you can search for keywords like „machine learning“ or „python“. Based on this it would find matching organisations from the archive and show their name, link and how many times they appeared in th GSOC from 2009-2018. 

General Structure: 

- imports to being in libraries 
- setup to define variables 
- main function() 
    - asks for a keyword,
    - scrapes the gsoc 2019 website,
    - checks each org’s tech tags,
    - prints results if they match your 
- main execution block 
    - calls scrape() if you run the script directly.
 

unknown: 
- signal handler
    - exit with ctrl+c 
- helper function: no_of_times 
    - checks how many times an organization has been in gsoc before 2019.

3. Function analysis: pick one function and analyze it in detail:

- What does this function do?

- 
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- How does it work (step by step)?

---

1. Takeaways: are there anything you can learn from the code? (How to structure your code, a clean solution for some function you might also need...)


1. What parts of the code were confusing or difficult at the beginning to understand?
- Were you able to understand what it is doing after your own research?
