### Assignment 11 Read Some Code
(Based on Exercise 23 in Learn Python the Hard Way)

At this point you should have gathered some basic knowledge in programming (Python).
Now it's time to dive into the wild and try to read some real code that people (not AI) wrote on the internet.

The goal is to exercise the following skills:
1. Finding Python source code for things you need
2. Navigating through the code and the file structure
3. Trying to understand the code you find 
4. Taking away some good coding pattern

Here's what you do:
1. Go to `github.com` and search for "python" or something related to your final project idea
2. Pick a project that is not too old (would be nice if it is maintained in the last five years) and preferably with many stars(the sign of good code)
3. Browse through the list of files and directories until you find a `.py` file (or multiple ones). The file should at least has 100 lines for you to have enough content to read.
4. Start at the top and read through the code, taking notes on what you think it does
5. If you encounter any symbols or syntax that seem new to you, look them up on the internet
6. Submit your result as a md file. See `code_study.md` as a template.
